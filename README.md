# Blind

### What is Blind?

Blind, working title, is an interactive cross-platform puzzle game, centered around themes pulled from physical and life sciences for the inquisitive layperson. Inspired by the latest in the ever-evolving domain of code-cracking, we intend to provide users with a set of beautiful, immersive and head-scratching puzzle-cracking experiences.

### Where to begin?

Since this project is still in development, our ideas are being curated in this [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@blind-1/s/blind/). Check this out to see first-hand, what's cooking behind the scenes. The development cycle is targeted towards getting better algorithms for all the key parts of the system. These are analyzed in the issues section. Drop in to see what's in the mix.

You can open the `app/` folder in Android studio and let gradle do it's magic. Use either DesktopLauncher or AndroidLauncher to get the game running on the platform of your choice. Upon finding a point of failure or lack, feel free to start a pull request. We are active regularly.

### The story.

One day I attended an interview and was asked to create a Tetris clone in few hours using LibGdx, an easily accessible, cross-platform engine on Java. I'd never even heard of the framework till then and in the time crunch, I didn't get a chance to think deeply about the architecture. My bad design caused unnecessary bugs and my interview blew. I'm returning to LibGdx again and this time with a proper plan for a brand new application. Folks out there are welcome to contribute and finish this story.
