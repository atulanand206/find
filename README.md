# Blind => Binquiz

### What is Blind?

Blind, working title, is an interactive cross-platform puzzle game, centered around themes pulled from physical and life sciences for the inquisitive layperson. Inspired by the latest in the ever-evolving domain of code-cracking, we intend to provide users with a set of beautiful, immersive and head-scratching puzzle-cracking experiences.

### Where to begin?

Since this project is still in development, our ideas are being curated in this [Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@blind-1/s/blind/). Check this out to see first-hand, what's cooking behind the scenes. The development cycle is targeted towards getting better algorithms for all the key parts of the system. These are analyzed in the issues section. Drop in to see what's in the mix.

You can open the `app/` folder in Android studio and let gradle do it's magic. Use either DesktopLauncher or AndroidLauncher to get the game running on the platform of your choice. Upon finding a point of failure or lack, feel free to start a pull request. We are active regularly.

### The story.

One day I attended an interview and was asked to create a Tetris clone in few hours using LibGdx, an easily accessible, cross-platform engine on Java. I'd never even heard of the framework till then and in the time crunch, I didn't get a chance to think deeply about the architecture. My bad design caused unnecessary bugs and my interview blew. I'm returning to LibGdx again and this time with a proper plan for a brand new application. Folks out there are welcome to contribute and finish this story.

### Update

Decided to pick a different project. Binquiz. Movies and TV Series Quiz. All the hours spent watching thrillers has to have a future. A multiplayer game, available in the browser, where a quizmaster and a bunch of players can get together for a session of binge quizzing. 

- The code is in the working stage, but no where near delivery. Bugs have creeped in at a lot of places.
- Whole lot of code has to be refactored and moved around, which is being guided by the unit & integration tests. 
- The best part, it tests the code after each commit and ensures that nothing leaks.
- The package server is shaping up nicely. The tests should really help become confident on its design. 
- Web app currently resides in a different repository. Look for its details on `atulanand206/algos`
- Web app design has room for improvement. Will get on this as soon as the server starts holding perfectly.
- Will update all the relevant documents as soon.
