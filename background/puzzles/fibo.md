These refs are for 3x3. Can be extended for 4x4 to have all the digits in the mix.

First 16 Fibonacci numbers - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,144, 233, 377, 610. 

* 0 -&gt; 2
* 1 -&gt; 6
* 2 -&gt; 3
* 3 -&gt; 6
* 4 -&gt; 3
* 5 -&gt; 3
* 6 -&gt; 1
* 7 -&gt; 2
* 8 -&gt; 2
* 9 -&gt; 1 
* T -&gt; 29, N -&gt; 16

The digit occurrence map gives 29 characters. 

* Adding 3 blank cells gives 32. 
* Subtracting 2 cells, maybe the zeroes and giving the freedom to add as many zeroes as they'd like, makes it 27. Can be connected to the Sudoku of 81 cells. - Feels far away from the space and may increase play time drastically. May work as separate puzzles.  
  * Can be generated using [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCHH5siBCg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCHH5siBCg). Quite efficiently.

A crime series can have 16 data points. The mentioned 16 numbers can be anagrammed and shown as dates and times of the events, \(for e.g., 7:37, 1:00, 0:02, 5:05, etc.\) leading upto the mega finale of solving the whole grid. Keeping it to the theme of maths specifications, 4 characters can provide 4 hints to figure out 4 numbers each. People should trip up over the subtlety involved which can be solved if you just knew a bit more about numbers.

Something like Olympics is about to commence at 8:00 on 14 April. On the night before the launch, the night guard was going through usual rounds of inspection found bodies of best male and female swimming contestants, who were destined to win the tournament rounds dead in the pool around 2:00 on 12 April, depends on whether can be solved in 2 days, can be adjusted. 

\[Some background about the contestants and speculations\] From same country, knew each other well, may or may not be involved with each other, there sure was an earlier connection which lead them to their double murder. Or was it accidental? Were they just devouring each other in the pool together before the practice and someone tripped somehow. Was there someone waiting for them to come to the pool at night time and poke them with a poisonous dart? Was the water electrified? More reasons, more ideas for clues. Was there any witness?

As the event is of major importance, the authorities would want smoothness and discretion. Only select officers would be made aware of the situations. But, highly skilled operatives, known for finishing the job in a day would be working to get everything figured out. There will some field agent and a commanding officer.

The event manager and investors, mayor look like major players.

The game could be of 45min-1hr. Two ways are evident. More characters and faded storyline which can't be covered in the specified time or detailing to these characters giving multiple easter eggs and ways to get to the solution.

Every level can be a screen with some parts still, some animated and some moving on interaction. The general color scheme of one round would be similar. A game would involve multiple levels and solutions of all the levels could be placed in something like a stack of jenga pieces one beside the other. The final level can be arrange the numbers into the 4x4 magic square and complete the puzzle uncovering some hidden and obscure information about binary and fibonacci numbers.
