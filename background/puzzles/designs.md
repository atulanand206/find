Screen 1: 

* Opening.
* Showing that the event is being publicised using posters in the city slums from where the major participants are competing and have a very good chance of catching some \[synonym of medals / not sure about silverware\]. 
* People of all ages are excited about the tournament as it booms the local economy. We might find a wall with multiple people under a bridge or something, clues can be embedded into graphiti art.

One properly set-up scene can have multiple clues available and a subset of those clues leads to the solution. The hint mechanism for clues has to be randomised. If 4 friends are playing a game, they should not see the hints in the same order. It should feel a bit personalised or at least different. 

The importance of hints plays a role in randomising their order. If they are of equal importance, showing them by picking randomly for every user is acceptable. But, if they are of different importance, give them a rating and don't show any hint with lower rating when a higher rating hint has been opened. It should also be ensured that all the necessary hints of lower rating are opened before opening a higher rating hint. If the user finds the clue by themselves, there is no impact on the hints mechanism. Different users will not see different hints and that could be turned into something interesting.
